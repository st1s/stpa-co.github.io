Hello,

My name is Stewan. I'm a fullstack engineer that works with web since 2007. Nowadays focused only on Javascript language, I like to code web and mobile applications fully organized, scalable and testable.

Contact-me in talk@stpa.co or follow me at [Github](https://github.com/stewones)

In past years the Javascript came taking incalculable proportions, making it impossible to work without their presence. Leaving the frontend scenario, by now it is possible to develop an entire application, including backend and database, using only this fantastic language.

Now many large companies like Google and Facebook, are heavily investing in development of tools written in Javascript. All with source opened by their Github.
